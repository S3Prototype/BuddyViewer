YT API Key AIzaSyBTBzkShyHTchB91sk-zFaSNv2qyyA8MXU

Watch2Gether constantly asks you to reconfirm your room in part because youtube requires a user to interact for the "autoplay" functionality to work. It appears youtube's API considers activating the video via javascript to be "autoplay".

player.playVideo()

This is how you check if the user has reached this page after a browser reload:
const perfEntries = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation");
    for(const perf of perfEntries){
        if (perf.type == "reload"){
            alert("YES!!");
        }
    }

nodemon --exec npm run babel-node -- ./server.js



(11/7/20) These are the logs from our last run. Note how nameToRelease seems to for some reason have the name of the previous messenger. Is that happening on the client side or the server side? Likely server side. Are there global variables I'm not aware of? Is there something going on where the name is not being updated because of certain if conditions?
