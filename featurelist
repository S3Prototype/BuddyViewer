FEATURE LIST:

* share secret link feature. Sends a link that contains the password, or a "secret" style link that is a different url with a key param in it that, when it hits the server, gets the users redirected to the room with the password stored.
    * Probably can just add some hashed password to the url param. When the user enters the url, unencrypt and check the param against the room password. If it passes, just let them into the room with some ejs value like 'secretLink: true', and they should be allowed in.
* For full screen, could use a grid, have video take up entire grid, have controls row in top and bottom just take up their rows with a higher z-index. Then when they're not used for a while, have them slide down until their y position is off screen.
    * Probably have to add a div that overlays the video, which catches events and when it's clicked/touched, it activates the controls.
* Have an upcoming theater list. Like people can schedule viewings in theaters. A user can sort by scheduled theaters. Kind of like a scheduled group viewing of something.
* Add ability to switch waht the default search is from youtube to other sites. Even allow them to type in the domain of the site they want searched.
* Polls in the room. Like strawpoll. Don't need to store it in the server at all.
    * Could have a poll pop up whenever the video is about to end saying "Next up: [video name and thumbnail] <Replay Current Video> <Skip to next video> <pause queue>
* Look up that media player functionality mentioned in the syntax.fm podcast.
* Pop out video player when user scrolls far enough down. Should just have one big playpause button.
* Playlists. People should be able to add to a custom playlist in the actual room, and the history should also be able to be played like a playlist. Users can add to the playlist if the admin allows it, or remove videos from the playlist.
* Add partials for the signup forms and room creation forms.
* People can become "admins" of rooms. These users always have host rights, and can change it so only certain people are able to change the video, play/pause, etc.
    * Maybe a premium feature.
* On the room list, say what's currently being watched. Try to get that damn gif youtube has when you hover over thumbnails.
* Rooms in the roomlist should show the flag of the host. But that's complex, involves IP resolving through 3rd party libraries.
* Banning users from your room.
* In the room list page, when you hover over the thumbnail it shows a box with the video name, description, and a progressbar set to their saved timestamp.
* Uploading your own videos temporarily for sharing
* Maybe add code for when the ENDED state is reached, so we can put our own "related videos/recommended videos" screen over the player. That way if the user clicks on one of them, we can make it play in our player.
* Add an emoji bar with a search feature for the chat
* Show what each other is typing in the searchbar, and constantly see each other's search results as they pop up while we type them. Also constantly see each other's cursors, except when they're over the video
    ** Ability to disable individual cursors so your screen isn't full of hell.
* Add private messaging functionality
* Right now you can set a room to private or locked, but not private and locked. Change that.
