FEATURE LIST:

* Chat should be like a floating tray. It should be like the userlist tray in Watch2Gether, always on the bottom, able to be popped up and popped down.
* Closed captions option
* Full screen button
* Looping
* Playback rate change
* Should have a row in the video player that shows the most recently sent message in the chat, maybe with a higher z-index so it just appears above the video and then eventually fades away.
* Also have a little chat icon button in the video player so you can bring the chat up at the side. If you're in fullscreen, chat appears in a z-index above the player.
* Uploading your own videos temporarily for sharing
* Being able to add a video with the "copy url at current time" so it actually starts at that time.
* When a user adds a link to another site's videos, what if we write code that just detects a button press within that iframe. It then stores the id/class of that button, and on the other clients triggers the same event on whatever button matches that id/class.
* Maybe add code for when the ENDED state is reached, so we can put our own "related videos/recommended videos" screen over the player. That way if the user clicks on one of them, we can make it play in our player.
* Add an emoji bar with a search feature for the chat
* Show what each other is typing in the searchbar, and constantly see each other's search results as they pop up while we type them. Also constantly see each other's cursors, except when they're over the video
    ** Ability to disable individual cursors so your screen isn't full of hell.
* Add a "desync my videos" button that lets the player play locally without sending state to server or aligning state.x11vnc
* Put your own overlay over the video whenever it's paused/ended so users can click a video and it'll load in the player.
    **This will require setting the iframe display to none in css everytime it pauses/stops, Perhaps leave an empty div in the video_container beneath the iframe, then whenever we set the iframe's display to none, we can set that placeholder div's display so it shows, and then put our stuff in there.
