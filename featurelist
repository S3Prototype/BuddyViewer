FEATURE LIST:

* Closed captions option
* Full screen button
* Looping
* Playback rate change
* Uploading your own videos temporarily for sharing
* Being able to add a video with the "copy url at current time" so it actually starts at that time.
* When a user adds a link to another site's videos, what if we write code that just detects a button press within that iframe. It then stores the id/class of that button, and on the other clients triggers the same event on whatever button matches that id/class.
* Maybe add code for when the ENDED state is reached, so we can put our own "related videos/recommended videos" screen over the player. That way if the user clicks on one of them, we can make it play in our player.
